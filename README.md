3. Set environment variables for the bot token and API keys:

```
	export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN='your_telegram_bot_token'
	export X_API_KEY='your_x_api_key'
```

4. Start the Flask server:

```python main.py```


### Usage
1. Set the webhook for your Telegram bot: Visit the /setwebhook endpoint on your server:

```https://your-domain/setwebhook```

2. Interact with the bot in Telegram:
- Use /start to begin.
- Use /generate <prompt> to create music.
- Use /cover <theme> to generate a cover image.

### Configuration
### Environment Variables
- **TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN**: Required. The token for your Telegram bot.
- **X_API_KEY: Optional**. For future social media integrations.

### Webhook Setup
- Replace YOUR_DOMAIN in the code with your actual server's domain.
- Ensure the bot token is correctly set.

### Dependencies
- Flask: For hosting the webhook.
- python-telegram-bot: To integrate with Telegram API.
- threading: For concurrent processing.

Install these libraries via:

```
    pip install flask python-telegram-bot
```
